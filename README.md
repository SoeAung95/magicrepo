Do not throw away Formulas which have no assigned cells (neither programmatic nor OCR)
Add some post-processing heuristics that look at the text to descide if a cluster label must be corrected
(e.g. flip text to caption label when the text starts with "fig" or "table")
Go through issues labeld with "layout", pick provided inputs, and decide if to make CVAT GT for it
Disable orphan creation code and check if it improves mAP
